## General Information
-“My Food Box is an easy-to-use application designed to help users keep track of the “lifespan” of their food by recording purchase dates and shelf life. It features an intuitive countdown timer for each item to ensure that users are reminded of the freshness of the ingredients, as well as pie charts to analyze and visualize the data against the ingredients. The project aims to simplify the process of tracking perishable foods and minimize food waste.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Tkinter (for GUI development)
- SQLite (for database management)

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Add Ingredient: Users can add a new ingredient, specifying the name, purchase date and expiration date.
- Countdown to expiration: Each ingredient has a progress bar showing the time remaining before it expires.
- Data Charts: The application uses a simple interface and colors to make it visually clean and intuitive.

## Setup
To set up and run “My Food Box” locally:
- Make sure Python 3.10 is installed.
- Install the required packages (e.g. Tkinter and SQLite, which come with Python).
- Run the Python script with the following code:
    'python my_food_box_2.0.py'

## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Click on “Open My Food Box” to view your current list of ingredients.
- To add a new item, click on the “Add Ingredient” button and enter the necessary details, you can choose the type of ingredient and the time unit.
- Check the progress bar for each ingredient to see how much time is left before it expires.
- If you need to delete an ingredient, select the ingredient and click the “Delete Selected” button.
- Click on the “Remove Expired” button to remove expired ingredients.

## Project Status
This project is currently under development. Although it already has basic functionality, it still lacks extensive trials and algorithms, and there may be undetected problems; future updates are planned to enhance the user interface and improve the efficiency of the application.

## Room for Improvement
- Notification system: Push notifications or email alerts can be added for items that are about to expire.
- Barcode Scanner: can try to implement the ability to scan barcodes for more efficient entry of ingredients.
- Cloud synchronization feature: can allow users to synchronize data between multiple devices.
